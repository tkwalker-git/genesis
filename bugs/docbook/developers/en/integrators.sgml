	<title>Integrating with MantisBT</title>

	<para>
		The primary means of integrating with MantisBT is with the SOAP
		API , bundled with MantisBT. The SOAP API is accessible at

			<title>Prebuilt SOAP stubs using Axis</title>

			<para>
				For ease of integration of the Java clients, SOAP stubs
				are maintained and deployed in the Maven central repository.
				To include them in your project, use the following coordinates:

			<programlisting>
	&lt;dependency&gt;
	    &lt;groupId&gt;biz.futureware.mantis&lt;/groupId&gt;
	    &lt;artifactId&gt;mantis-axis-soap-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;
	    &lt;version&gt;1.2.6&lt;/version&gt;
	&lt;/dependency&gt;
			</programlisting>

			<para>Alternatively, download the latest available version from

			<title>Usage in OSGi environments</title>
			<para>If you would like to use Axis in an OSGi environment, it is
			recommended that you use a ready-made bundle, such as the Axis
			bundle available from <ulink url="http://download.eclipse.org/tools/orbit/downloads/">

                <title>Compatibility between releases</title>
 
                <para>The SOAP API signature will change between minor releases, typically to add new functionality or to extend existing features.
                </para>
                <para>Some of these changes might require a refresh of the client libraries generated, for instance Apache Axis 1 SOAP stubs must be
                regenerated if a complex type receives a new property. Such changes will be announced before the release of the new MantisBT version
                on the <ulink url="http://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/mantisbt-soap-dev"> mantisbt-soap-dev mailing list</ulink> . 
                Typically there will be two weeks time to integrate the new SOAP stubs.</para>
