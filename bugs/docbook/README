Building the DocBook Manuals
============================

Go to the directory containing manual to build, e.g. :

    $ cd adminguide/en

Build the guide in the desired format, e.g. :

    $ make html

Resulting files will be placed in build/ subdirectory.

Please refer to the MantisBT wiki[1] for complete details on how to
install the required tools and build the documentation.
