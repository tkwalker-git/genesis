This will be during Theo's winter break.

We would like to extend the opportunity for anyone else who has the finances to join us and who would like to join us.  

Ignore the dates for now.  It will be in December, but until Theo knows his exact schedule we won't actually have a set date yet. 

If you have any inclination of wanting to go please hit the "maybe" and of course it isn't a binding contract or anything.  Just like to get an idea of who would like to join if it works out.

                    [description] => Chalene Johnson is not only an entrepreneur, TV fitness personality, clothing designer, author, motivational speaker, choreographer, wife, mother of 2, a relatable girl next door BUT she is my mentor and friend.  

Over two Two years ago I packed everything I owned into my lil' two-door Honda civic.  I drove 1,000 miles away from my family, my friends, everything I ever knew (even left my puppy dog at home) all for a dream.  As I was driving across the country I knew that I had no place to live, a job at the hospital that paid little to nothing and no justification that I was leaving everything I owned for a reason.  
 
I moved to Orlando, FL with only a dream...a dream that would allow me to share the passion that Chalene had instilled within me to as many people as remotely possible.  Two years later people in Florida not only know who Chalene is, but they have there own stories of how she has changed their lives!  Like my amazingly wonderful friend Meghan Kehoe who has now lost 94lbs since Dec. 2nd b/c of Chalene...Susannah Johnson, Ashley Grobowski, and Karen De Castro all were in the Turbo Fire Infomerial...and are FLORIDA girls.  We are ready to bring her back to the Sunshine State with open arms. 

I can't do this alone, we need to show Chalene how much she means to us, how much she has changed our lives and how amazing her BOOK RELEASE will be if she holds it here in Orlando, FL on 11/11/2011.  

Please click ATTEND if you are willing to pay a minimal $25 for an hour training with Chalene Johnson herself on Nov. 11th, 2011!  Yes it's a year in advance...but we've gotta pre-plan ppl!  Not only will you get a FREE signed copy of her new book, but you will get the chance to show Chalene the huge impact she has had on the Sunshine STATE!

                    [description] => Carnival Cruiseline: "Dream" is the name of the Ship. Built in 2009 it holds 3,600 passangers. It is one of the newest and largest ships. 7 days with stops in Nassau-Bahama's......St. Thomas and St. Marrten......Cruise Rates vary based on the type of room you want. Inside cabin will be around $1,200 per couple a suite is $2,590 per couple and they have rooms in between. All that is needed now is a $250.00 deposit per person and the rest has to be paid 60 days before cruise. We are just trying to find out how many people are interested in going. If anyone has any questions about a cruise you can get with myself or Marcia Curtis. I will have the exact price for each cabin style in a few days.....we are trying to get at least 8 cabins so we can get a group discount. Anybody is welcome to come so pass this on to your friends and family.

As a follow up to the platinum-selling Soldier Of Love, which spent three weeks at the top of the Billboard album chart and garnered a well-deserved Grammy, Sade is back with The Ultimate Collection to be released on May 3. In addition to classic Sade songs, the must-have album will include three new, never-before heard songs including â€œMoon & The Skyâ€ (featuring Jay-Z). Here for the first time, fans can find all of their favorite Sade classics from their most iconic albums including songs from the Best Of collection and the greatest hits off of Loverâ€™s Rock and Soldier Of Love. The track listing for The Ultimate Collection will be revealed shortly. Sade also announced today, the second leg of their ultimate summer tour kicking off on June 16th, marking their highly anticipated return to the world stage in ten years. 

Pre-orders of the album begin today at Sade.com. Fans who pre-order The Ultimate Collection will have exclusive early access to tickets beginning March 30th in select markets. For complete presale and ticket on sale information, visit Sade.com. Tickets for the newly announced dates go on sale to the public beginning April 2nd at Ticketmaster.com and LiveNation.com. 

Sade will be joined on tour by fellow Grammy winner John Legend, performing in top arenas across North America, in an effort to reach their vast and loyal fans. Sadeâ€™s classic sound set to haunting, unmistakable vocals creates the most intimate of concert experiences in a way that only an unforgettable Sade performance can. Sade performed for more than a million fans during their last tour in 2001. 

The accomplishments of Soldier Of Love so far are astounding. The single, â€œSoldier of Loveâ€ - which Sade co-produced with Mike Pela, and was written by Sade along with longtime collaborators Andrew Hale, Stuart Matthewman and Paul Spencer Denman made radio history upon its release. In less than four weeks â€œSoldier of Loveâ€ propelled into the top five at both Urban Hot AC and Smooth Jazz radio charts, making it one of the fastest moving records of the year. The track held the #1 spot at Urban Hot AC radio for four weeks straight and topped the Smooth Jazz chart for two weeks. Sade is now the first group since the Isley Brothers in 2001 to earn a #1 spot as a lead act on the R&B Chart. 

Known for their one of a kind timeless sound, Sade has enjoyed phenomenal success both internationally and stateside throughout the span of their twenty-seven year career. Since the release of their debut album, Diamond Life in 1984 the band has seen all five of their studio albums land in the Top 10 on Billboardâ€™s Top 200 Album Chart selling a total of more than 50 million albums worldwide to date. Theyâ€™ve been nominated for American Music Awards, MTV Video Music Awards and have won four Grammy Awards â€“ first in 1986 for Best New Artist, then in 1994 for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group for â€œNo Ordinary Loveâ€, again in 2002 for Best Pop Vocal Album with Lovers Rock and most recently in 2011 for Best R&B Performance By A Duo Or Group for â€œSoldier Of Loveâ€. 

John Legend, who will join Sade on all tour stops, is a nine-time Grammy Award winner. His most recent work with the Roots on WAKE UP! won awards for Best R&B Album, Best R&B Song (â€œShineâ€) and Best Traditional R&B Vocal Performance (â€œHang On In Thereâ€) at the 2010 53rd Annual Grammy Awards Ceremony.

                    [description] => Catch NEEDTOBREATHE live as they open for Taylor Swift on the North American portion of her â€œSpeak Nowâ€ World Tour 2011! "It means a lot to us that Taylor hand-picked us for her Speak Now tour,â€ NEEDTOBREATHE guitarist and co-songwriter Bo Rinehart says. â€œEveryone knows she has amazing fans, and we thrive on performing live, especially in front of new audiences.â€


Since the 2006 release of their debut album on Atlantic Records, NEEDTOBREATHE has enjoyed great success across several radio formats, and played more than 1,000 live shows, increasing their audience at each turn. Maybe best known for their hits â€œSomething Beautifulâ€ and â€œMore Time,â€ their music has been featured in countless television shows and movies, including MTVâ€™s â€œThe Hills,â€ and the motion picture P.S. I Love You. The band has built an impressive following for their live shows, which are renowned for their seamless blend of ambient, arena-ready soundscapes with the bandâ€™s own decidedly Southern sensibility. NEEDTOBREATHEâ€™s third and most recent album, â€œTHE OUTSIDERS,â€ was released late last summer to universal critical acclaim and a Top 20 debut on the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart. The band plans to record and release a new album for Atlantic in 2011.

At the event, our team will camp out overnight and take turns walking around the track to raise money and awareness to help the American Cancer Society create a world with less cancer and more birthdays.

Saving lives from cancer starts one team, one participant, and one dollar at a time. Our team is doing our part to make sure that cancer never steals another year of anyoneâ€™s life. 

Please visit our event page for more information. The impact we can make together is much greater than what any of us could do alone!

The American Cancer Society Relay For Life is a life-changing event that gives everyone in communities across the globe a chance to celebrate the lives of people who have battled cancer, remember loved ones lost, and fight back against the disease. At Relay, teams of people camp out at a local high school, park, or fairground and take turns walking or running around a track or path. Each team is asked to have a representative on the track at all times during the event. Because cancer never sleeps, Relays are overnight events up to from 18 - 24 hours in length.

"Opening early 2011, The Beacham a live music venue and state of the art nightclub in the heart of Downtown Orlando. The history of the building dates back to the early 1920s when it touted famed vaudevillian acts. What's old is new again, with true-to-the-original renovations creating a historic, yet state-of-the-art spot to catch the hottest national touring acts. Connected by a common doorway to The Social, the two venues will create the most intimate and privately owned live music destination in the South-eastern United States. "

DIESELBOY // DRUM AND BASS/DUBSTEP // NYC // HUMAN IMPRINT, SUBHUMAN, CIRCLE MANAGEMENT

***Voted Americas #1 Drum and Bass DJ***

The best known face and sound in American drum and bass for over a decade belongs to Brooklyn-based Dieselboy, aka Damian Higgins. Now an international icon in this underground dance music movement, Dieselboy is the most in-demand American d&b DJ on the global club, festival and rave circuits on six continents. Since the early â€˜90s Dieselboy has pioneered drum and bass in North America. His prized mixes have been the gateway for countless loyal fans to the high energy, futuristic, science fiction vibe of d&b.

Dieselboy has an intense week in / week out touring schedule and has played most of the major festivals including Coachella, Bonnaroo, Electric Daisy Carnival, Nocturnal Wonderland, Ultra, Love Parade, Starscape, Shambhala, Movement, Virgin Festival, Creamfields (UK), Jisan (Seoul), Phat (NZ), Pirate Station (Russia), and on and on. His original music has been featured on MTV and ESPN as well as video games, commercials, etc. He has also been featured on the cover and inside of many magazines including URB, Billboard, DJ, DJ Times, and Mixmag.

Dieselboy currently runs two record labels including the celebrated US drum and bass imprint Human and the recent dubstep and electro up and comer SubHuman. On top of all of this Dieselboy has also conceptualized and initiated the longest running tour in electronic music, Planet of the Drums, and the recent metal-themed multimedia extravaganza Monsters Of Jungle.

BARE // DUBSTEP // LOS ANGELES, CA // SUBHUMAN, CIRCLE MANAGEMENT

**Voted Beatport's Best New Artist of 2010***

Representing Los Angeles, California, BARE aka Sean Rodela has become one of the most talked about new producers making waves on the worldwide dubstep circuit. The BARE sound is a product of deep roots in west coast hip-hop (as part of the Vital Mindz collective) and aggressive drum â€˜nâ€™ bass (as Reborn) â€“ these influences, combined with crisp drum programming and mind altering basslines, spawn face melting dubstep anthems that almost rewind themselves. February saw BAREâ€™s first vinyl release, the ragga-influenced dancefloor smasher â€˜Cultureâ€™, on Terminal Dusk Recordings. Alongside the massive â€˜Talk Too Loudâ€™ on the flip, the release was charted by DJâ€™s over the world (via Chemical Records), and put BARE on the radar alongside other members of the already incendiary LA dub community. 

In April THE GROUPIE LOVE LIFE EP was released on Reid Speedâ€™s Play Me Records, and the A-side â€˜Lifeâ€™ instantly secured a coveted spot in the Beatport dubstep top 10 â€“ an amazing accomplishment for a fresh producer. In the weeks to follow, â€˜Lifeâ€™ peaked at number four on the charts, and would continue to dominate the top ten for close to a month â€“ the B-side â€˜Groupie Loveâ€™ was never far behind. The wheels were in motion, and around the same time BAREâ€™s tracks caught the attention of drum and bass legend Dieselboy, resulting in a massive all A-side LP being secured for the third release on SubHuman Recordings (Humanâ€™s new dubstep offshoot) later this year. More original tracks and remixes are currently confirmed for HollowPoint Rec, Buygore, Licked Beats (UK), Trillbass, Play Me, TLD and Ultragore Recordings. 

BARE lives and breathes music, his studio output is staggering to even the most seasoned producers. His tunes make regular appearances in the sets of Dieselboy, Excision, Datsik, Trillbass, Downlink, Borgore, Mark Instinct, Juan Basshead and Reid Speed. Studio collaborations with Muffler, Symbl, NumberNin6, Downlink, J Messinian, and Mark Instinct are already in the works, with many more planned for the future as time allows. As a DJ, BARE is quickly building a reputation as a tough act to follow â€“ his sets (largely comprised of his own material) are a nonstop low end assault, fluidly mixed collections of banger after banger that reduce dance floors to smoldering ash. BARE was recently recruited to Circle Managementâ€™s roster (alongside Datsik, Borgore, and Funtcase, to name a few) and his performance schedule is already filling up fast. Itâ€™s fair to say BARE has been on a high speed elevator to the big leagues since day one, and shows no sign of slowing down.

SMASH GORDON // DUBSTEP/DRUMSTEP/ELECTRO // BALTIMORE, MD // SUBHUMAN, STEEZ PROMO, CIRCLE MANAGEMENT

It's pretty amazing that Baltimore Native Steven "SMASH" Gordon is able to find time to DJ- After all, his days are already spent running one of the most successful promotional companies in electronic music- Steez Promo, as well as being a partner in the ever-expanding worldwide bass handler, Circle Management. If that wasn't enough, Steve also recently joined with long-time friend Damian Higgins, (Also known as Drum n' Bass Legend Dieselboy) to form subHUMAN, a bass driven label repping bass masters such as Dieselboy, Muffler, Numbernin6, Bare, and the man himself, Mr. Smash Gordon. This label will certainly be one to watch over the next coming months and years- but you won't have to look very hard to find subHUMAN- just check the top of the dubstep charts.

Yet even after all of this rapid activity, Mr. Gordon still finds time to step into his alter ego, Smash Gordon, to wreck the decks and clubs nationwide- and with his new "SMASH YOUR FUCKING FACE" mix, he's done just that. You'll hear the best Dubstep, Electro, Drum n' Bass, and even Baltimore Club Music this side of the UK during these 78 absolutely filthy minutes- bringing true meaning to the term "multi-genre". Filled with club bangers, classics, and the tunes you wish you'd already heard and shared with everyone you know, we are proud to present SMASH GORDON's new mix, "SMASH YOUR FUCKING FACE VOLUME 2". Enjoy!

AIDS Walk Orlando 2011
Hope and Help of Central Florida started AIDS Walk Orlando in 1995. Over the years this event has grown thanks to your participation! Only with your support can we continue to raise funds to help those affected by HIV/AIDS in our Central Florida community.

Last year we had over 1,800 participants- this year we are shooting for 2,000! The more people that participate - the more money we raise for the Hope and Help CenterÂ´s life saving programs! The Hope and Help Center continues to provide the community with vital services such as HIV testing, youth outreach and prevention, peer mentoring, medical case management, food pantry, insurance and pharmacy coverage and much more.
